#' magic_coin
#' 
#' function to look for a random seed that results in as many successes in a row as possible when running the command, `rbinom(50, 1, 0.5)`.

#' @param seeds A vector of random seeds to test
#' @param input List of seeds that have been tested - names are seeds, values are the number of successes in a row
#' 
#' @return An updated list combining `input` with results from `seed`
