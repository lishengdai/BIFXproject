## R Intro

Fill out [this Quarto document](https://github.com/BIFX552-22/CourseInfo/hw/02Rintro.qmd) while completing the R Intro lesson.

### [Introduction to R and RStudio](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/01-rstudio-intro/index.html)

## Key Points

-   Use RStudio to write and run R programs.
-   R has the usual arithmetic operators and mathematical functions.
-   Use `<-` to assign values to variables.
-   Use `ls()` to list the variables in a program.
-   Use `rm()` to delete objects in a script.
-   Use `install.packages()` to install packages and `library()` to load them.
:::

#### Challenge 1

Which of the following are valid R variable names?

    min_height
    max.height
    _age
    .mass
    MaxLength
    min-length
    2widths
    celsius2kelvin

-   Valid
-   Invalid

#### Challenge 2

What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the following program?

```{r}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20
```

#### Challenge 3

Run the code from the previous challenge, and write a command to compare `mass` to `age`. Is mass larger than age?

```{r}
# comparison code goes here
```

#### Challenge 4

Clean up your working environment by deleting the mass and age variables.

```{r}
# code goes here
```

#### Challenge 5

Install the following packages: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `gapminder`

```{r}
# this will fail if the required packages are not installed
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
```

### [Project Intro](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/02-project-intro/index.html)

## Key Points

-   Use RStudio to create and manage projects with consistent layout.
-   Treat raw data as read-only.
-   Treat generated output as disposable.
-   Separate function definition and application.
:::

#### Challenge 1

Create a self-contained project

We're going to turn our course project into a project in RStudio:

1.  If you haven't already, clone your course project onto your local machine.
2.  In RStudio, click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
3.  Click "Existing Directory" and locate the directory containing your course project.
4.  Click the "Create Project" button.

#### Challenge 2

Open an RStudio project through the file system

1.  Exit RStudio.
2.  Navigate to your course project directory.
3.  Create a new directory titled `hw/` and save this file into that directory.
3.  Double click the `.Rproj` file in the rood directory of your course project repository.
4.  Open this file in RStudio.
4.  Take a screenshot of your RStudio session and place it in the `hw/img/` directory. It should have "BIFXproject - main - RStudio" in the header (or something similar).
5.  Modify the line just below this to include your screenshot.

#### Challenge 3

You should have installed the `gapminder` package. If you are following along with the Software Carpentry notes, they ask us to download the gapminder data set at this point. Instead, we'll load it directly from the `gapminder` package (i.e. you get this challenge for free).

```{r}
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)

# let's take a look at the data we'll be working with
gapminder
```


### [Seeking Help](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/03-seeking-help/index.html)

::: callout-tip
## Key Points

Use `help()` or `?` to get help in R.
:::

#### Challenge 1

Look at the help page for `c`. What kind of vector do you expect will be creeated if you evaluate the following?

```{r}
c(1, 2, 3)
c('d', 'e', 'f')
c(1, 2, 'f')
```

#### Challenge 2

Look at the help for the `paste` function. You will need to use it later. What’s the difference between the `sep` and `collapse` arguments?

#### Challenge 3

Use help to find a function (and its associated parameters) that you could use to load data from a tabular file in which columns are delimited with “\t” (tab) and the decimal point is a “.” (period). This check for decimal separator is important, especially if you are working with international colleagues, because different countries have different conventions for the decimal point (i.e. comma vs period).

# Hint
Use `??"read table"` to look up functions related to reading in tabular data.
